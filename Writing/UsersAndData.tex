% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
% % pdf code
% \else
% % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex). ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Users disclose their personal data into numerous software systems, such as web sites, mobile applications and even into payment systems when they tap their bank card every time they shop \cite {federal2007fair}. With the pervasiveness of technology users today disclose a huge amount of personal information, such as their address, credit card and banking details and even their health conditions, into online applications. When users disclose more data into software applications, the ways through which user privacy could be compromised through these software systems increase. 

Disclosure of personal details always comes with an associated privacy risk that concerns users. Users are known to be reluctant to disclose data into software systems they cannot trust, because using data for reasons unforeseen by users and loss of data to third parties unknown to the user could result in privacy vulnerabilities. Because of this, privacy conscious users face many problems when they make decisions to disclose their information into software systems such as : How sensitive is this data for me? Who can view this data in this application? For what purposes will this data be used? However the apparent effect these concerns have on the disclosure decisions of the user is not directly observable. Lack of understanding about the aspects that concern users when they disclose data not only makes users uncomfortable when interacting with software systems, but also makes it difficult for privacy researchers and software developers to make data collection decisions when designing  software systems. 

In order to ensure user privacy preferences are met, developers need to be able to measure and quantify privacy of certain data items are for users. For such a measurement to be done, first one needs to identify the factors that affect privacy of data items for a user and the relationship among these factors. For example, would users be more comfortable sharing their credit card number with their banking application than their social networking account? Would users be equally comfortable sharing their blood group with their banking application? Would users be more comfortable sharing their age than their birthdate with their social networking account? Answering these questions are difficult yet important. A privacy risk metric that could determine the privacy of different data items in a given setting would be beneficial for users, software developers and also privacy researchers. From a user perspective, knowing how private their data are would help them to decide whether or not to disclose certain data items into software systems. From a developer's perspective they could decide which data to collect and which data to avoid when designing software systems in order to protect user privacy within the systems. For privacy researchers this information could be used when making measurements on user privacy among different software systems and provide guidance for law makers and authorities to enforce data protection regulations.

In this research we attempt to extract how users perceive different aspects of data that leads to their decisions in disclosing their data into software systems. Using a survey with 151 respondents we observe how users perceive the sensitivity of the data items to the user, relatedness of the data items to the purpose of an application and the visibility a particular data item gets in an application when they decide to disclose their data into software systems. With this knowledge we attempt to build a relationship relating how sensitivity, visibility and relatedness of data items relate to user privacy. We measure perceived privacy risk when users disclose their data items in different settings. Furthermore, through a qualitative analysis we attempt to identify other factors, if any, that could affect users data disclosure decisions.

This paper has two contributions.

\begin{itemize}
\item  First, measure privacy of data disclosure decisions. A metric to measure privacy that takes into account the context in which it is disclosed (by considering the relatedness of the data item to the application context) would help software developers to make decisions about collecting, storing and using different data items in software systems. 
\item Second, understanding factors that affect users' data disclosure decisions. Understanding factors that affect users' decisions to disclose their data into software systems would help organizations to build positive relationships with users when they collect user data for different services and business purposes. 
\end{itemize}

The paper is structured as follows. We first discuss prevoius work that has identified the parameters (sensitivity, visibility and relatedness) in measuring privacy in the background section. Then we describe our user study followed by the results. Next, we discuss the implicatins of our findings followed by the conclusion and future work.


\section {Research Methodology}

Our goal in this research is to understand how sensitivity, visibility and relatedness affect users' decision making when they disclose their personal data into software systems. For this, we conducted an online survey with 133 users. We designed the survey with 4 simple questions with Likert scales, to understand how users would feel if they are to disclose their personal data into different types of software applications. We used a list of 10 data items and asked users how they would feel disclosing those data items in four different application contexts. We used a five point Likert scale with values, very uncomfortable, somewhat uncomfortable, neutral, somewhat comfortable and very comfortable for users to express their feelings. Following these four questions we also used an open ended question to identify any factors other than what we investigated in the survey, that could affect users data disclosure decisions when they interact with software systems. At the end of the survey, we included questions to extract the demographics of the participants. However, we included an option \textit{prefer not to say} in all these questions, so that users could avoid disclosing their age, gender and educational background.

The survey design was evaluated with two participants. We fine tuned the wording of the questionnaire with the feedback of these two participants. Then the survey was distributed using social media platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) and personal connections of the authors. Before proceeding to the survey participants were given a brief introduction about the survey and the duration of the survey (under 10 minutes, calculated using the participants who evaluated the questionnaire). We also provided the participants with the contact details of the researchers. The research methodology (survey design, participant recruitment and results collection) was approved by the university ethic committee responsible for ethical conduction of studies that involve human subjects.

We measured the participant adequacy while collecting data and stopped data collection once we reached sample adequacy at KMO = 0.9. We then analyzed the data to obtain results.

\subsection {Data Analysis}

We assigned values from 1 to 5 for the answers we received on the Likert scale as follows.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Assigning values to Likert Scale preferences}
\begin{center}
\begin{adjustbox}{width=0.5\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.75\linewidth}|p{0.25\linewidth}|}
\hline
Likert Scale Preference & Value Assigned \\
\hline
Very Comfortable & 1\\
\hline
Somewhat Comfortable& 2 \\
\hline
Neutral & 3  \\
\hline
Somewhat Uncomfortable & 4 \\
\hline
Very Uncomfortable & 5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{center}

The goal of our research was to calculate the relationship between sensitivity, relatedness and visbility of data when users make their disclosure decisions. The data we collected in the study was the feeling of disclosure of data by participants in different scenarios. From this we first calculate the
\begin{itemize}
\item Feeling for sensitivity -  $F_S$, 
\item Feeling of visibility - $F_V$ and the 
\item Feeling of relatedness -  $F_R$
\end{itemize}
for each participant when they discose data into software applications. This calculation was done as follows.
 \begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split} 
\text{Feeling of Sensitivity}(F_{S}) & = \\ \frac{\text{\text{Sharing a sensitive data item in an application}}}{\text{Sharing a not so sensitive data item in the same application}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We defined sensitive elements following the European Data Protection Regulation's definition for the data analysis. According to their definition we identified, user's credit card details, user's health information (subscribed medicine, blood type) as sensitive data and user's name as a not so sensitive data item. 

Similarly, 

 \begin{equation} \label{eq2}
\begin{split}
\text{Feeling of Visibility}(F_{V})  & = \\ \frac{\text{Sharing a data item in an application where the user cannot control the visibility of the data item}}{\text{sharing the same data item in an application where the user can control the visibility}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
\begin{split}
\text{Feeling of Relatedness}(F_{R}) & = \\ \frac{\text{Sharing a related data item into an application}}{\text{sharing an unrelated data item in the same application}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}


Then we obtain the average values for $F_S$, $F_V$ and $F_R$ across all participants to get the average feeling. Using the average values for the feelings we calculate the relationship between the parameters as follows,
 \begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
Sensitivity\_vs\_Relatedness & = \\ \frac{\text{Feeling of Sensitivity}(F_{S})}{\text{Feeling of Relatedness}(F_{R})} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

 \begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
Sensitivity\_vs\_Visibility & = \\ \frac{\text{Feeling of Sensitivity}(F_{S})}{\text{Feeling of Visibility}(F_{V}) } 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

 \begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
Visibility\_a\_Relatedness & = \\ \frac{\text{Feeling of Visibility}(F_{V}) }{\text{Feeling of Relatedness}(F_{R})} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}




\section {Results}

We tested the validity of our results with Cronbach's alpha (0.91) and the participant adequacy for correlations with KMO (KMO = 0.82). 

\section{Discussion}

\section {Limitations}

The study had several limitations. Firstly this was a remote survey. While remote surveys are beneficial in getting a large sample of participants in a relatively small period of time, direct engagement with users would disclose more in depth information when it comes to qualitative analysis. However, the main contribution of the paper was the derivation of the privacy measurement formula. Furthermore, for the qualitative component of data analysis we reached data saturation with the codes with 17 participants. The survey had 133 respondents which makes the results valid. Contextual studies involving real time applications that directly engage users in a natural setting could be used to observe how our findings stand in such setups.
